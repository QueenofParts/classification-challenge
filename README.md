Module 13 Challenge - Marnie Brannon

This is an exercise assigned to the class to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts covered in Modules up to and including module 13 of AI Bootcamp.

Motivation:
My motivation in this working on this challenge is to practice and solidify several data coding concepts and practices. The exercise needed to use the following ML concepts discussed in class: test and train data, scaling features, using models such as linear regression and random forest, predicting and evaluating the model results. I worked on this alone (one of my first) getting all of my answers from our slide, in class examples, and AI sites such as chat GPT or the bootcamp's Xpert Learning Assistant.  I am very proud of myself for getting through my first exercise without getting "stuck" and having to use office hours, tutoring or other students to help me get past the snag.  

The focus of this exercise:
This project asks a simple question: which of the two classification models is more accurate indetecting spam? The problem it solves is: Improving the email filtering system for the customers of an ISP, using a provided dataset.

What did you learn?
In completing this exercise I learned the following: 

‚Ä¢ that I am getting more confident in my coding

‚Ä¢ that linear regression and random forest classification models are easy to use

‚Ä¢ that you can accurately predict the results you are looking for if you use the right model,
provided you have good quality data

What did you struggloe with?
I struggled with importing functions at first but Omar helped me by recognizing a naming error that prevented my code from working. Once that was cleared up, i was able to continue fairly well.
I also had a problem with the program getting stuck on line 27 where I accidentally left off a comma. I did eventually find that by Chat GPT after much frustration. Tutor Lebuso Philly helped me corrct the format of the return and streamline a few clunky bits of code I'd made.

License:
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to https://choosealicense.com/.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections. Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time. Features If your project has a lot of features, list them here. How to Contribute If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. Tests Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.provides predictive results using inputed interest rates
